    <h1>Make Antarctica great again/h1>
    <p>We here at MAGA want to bring attention to the downfall of Antarctica over the years and the recent  events that are starting to make Antarctica great again. As we all know Antarctica used to be a lush green continent until those nasty little penguins turned it icy for there own needs.</p>
